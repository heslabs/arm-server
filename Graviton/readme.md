### Amazon Unveils Graviton4: A 96-Core ARM CPU with 536.7 GBps Memory Bandwidth (2023.11)
https://www.anandtech.com/show/21172/amazon-unveils-graviton4-a-96core-cpu-with-5367-gbs-memory-bandwidth

* The AWS Graviton4 processor packs 96 cores that offer on average 30% higher compute performance compared to Graviton3 and is 40% faster in database applications as well as 45% faster in Java applications, according to Amazon.
* Given that Amazon did not reveal many details about its Graviton4, it is hard to attribute performance increases to any particular characteristics of the CPU.
* NextPlatform believes that the processor uses **Arm Neoverse V2 cores**, which are more capable than V1 cores used in previous-generation AWS processors when it comes to instruction per clock (IPC).
* Furthermore, the new CPU is expected to be fabricated using one of **TSMC's N4 process** technologies (4nm-class), which offers a higher clock-speed potential than TSMC's N5 nodes.
