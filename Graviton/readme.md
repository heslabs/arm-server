### AWS Graviton4

Performance gains with AWS Graviton4 â€“ a DevitoPRO case study (2024.10)
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/hpc/performance-gains-with-aws-graviton4-a-devitopro-case-study/

* The AWS Graviton4 processor represents a significant leap forward, with **96 Neoverse V2 cores** and an enhanced memory subsystem.
* The **12 DDR5-5600 channels** provide up to 75% more memory bandwidth than Graviton3 which is beneficial for memory-bound HPC workloads like seismic imaging.

### Amazon Unveils Graviton4: A 96-Core ARM CPU with 536.7 GBps Memory Bandwidth (2023.11)
https://www.anandtech.com/show/21172/amazon-unveils-graviton4-a-96core-cpu-with-5367-gbs-memory-bandwidth

* The AWS Graviton4 processor packs 96 cores that offer on average 30% higher compute performance compared to Graviton3 and is 40% faster in database applications as well as 45% faster in Java applications, according to Amazon.
* Given that Amazon did not reveal many details about its Graviton4, it is hard to attribute performance increases to any particular characteristics of the CPU.
* NextPlatform believes that the processor uses **Arm Neoverse V2 cores**, which are more capable than V1 cores used in previous-generation AWS processors when it comes to instruction per clock (IPC).
* Furthermore, the new CPU is expected to be fabricated using one of **TSMC's N4 process** technologies (4nm-class), which offers a higher clock-speed potential than TSMC's N5 nodes.

## Amazon EC2 M7g Instances

https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m7g/

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) M7g instances, powered by the latest generation AWS Graviton3 processors, designed for general purpose workloads.
* M7g instances are ideal for workloads such as application servers, microservices, gaming servers, mid-size data stores, and caching fleets. They offer up to 25% better performance over the sixth-generation AWS Graviton2-based M6g instances.
* M7g instances feature Double Data Rate 5 (DDR5) memory, which provides 50% higher memory bandwidth compared to DDR4 memory to enable high-speed access to data in memory.
* M7g instances deliver up to 25% better performance over Graviton2-based M6g. They are ideal for general purpose applications, such as application servers, microservices, gaming servers, mid-size data stores, and caching fleets.
